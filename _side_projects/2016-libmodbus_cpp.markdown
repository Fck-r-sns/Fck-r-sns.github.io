[Modbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus) is a data communications protocol for computer systems, sensors and hardware actors. It is used for production pipeline automation and for SCADA monitoring.

[libmodbus](https://github.com/stephane/libmodbus) is a popular library for modbus, but it is written in pure C. `libmodbus_cpp` is a C++/Qt wrapper for easier integration into Qt projects that we were working on at that moment. Because the original library is LGPL project, we decided to share the wrapper at GitHub.

Technologies used: C++, Qt
