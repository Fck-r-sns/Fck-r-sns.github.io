`Slower Than Light` is a game for Finnish Game Jam 2020 (a Global Game Jam branch). The theme was "Repair," so we decided to create a game about an alien trying to get to his home on a constantly breaking ship. To fix the ship, a player needs to solve puzzles. The puzzle is an alien ship device. Each device contains a set of pieces that are supposed to look like alien technology.

Once in a while, a device breaks, and some pieces fall off. To fix them, a player needs to put the pieces back to their original places. We wanted to create a feeling that the player doesn't understand this alien technology but somehow fixes the devices.
