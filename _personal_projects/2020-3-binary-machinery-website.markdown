One day I learned that GitHub has GitHub Pages, and that I can use this service to create a static website. I thought I would make a cool static blog/portfolio website; I just needed to create a repository, install Jekyll, pick a UI theme, and GitHub will do the rest.

Apparently, I was wrong. Yes, GitHub Pages are cool, and deployment went smoothly, but I had to write a bunch of layout files for Jekyll manually, which are a mix of HTML, YAML, and Liquid templates. At least it works, and you (most probably) are looking at it right now.

Technologies used: Jekyll, GitHub Pages, HTML, CSS.
