I had some design ideas (and still do) about a strategy game where a player protects his/her city from kaijus, UFOs, titans, and other giant monsters. This project is an RTS prototype with the real-time unit and resource management.

The prototype showed that RTS is not a very good idea. I think that a city-builder with indirect unit control would fit the story better.

Technologies used: C#, Unity.
