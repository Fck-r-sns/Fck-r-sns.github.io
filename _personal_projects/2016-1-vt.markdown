---

I wanted to create a mobile top-down shooter game where tactic decisions and information are more important than the player's reaction. In the prototype, a player can draw a character's movement trajectory and select the direction of view at each step of this trajectory. This prototype was inspired by [Frozen Synapse](https://youtu.be/BOlV_9DYnOw).

After some time spent with the prototype, I decided that such a control system is too complicated for a mobile game. The selected technology (libGDX) wasn't very promising and popular to continue development with it. The game idea had some game design issues. So, in the end, I decided not to continue working on the prototype.

Technologies used: Java, libGDX.
