`Dystopian Horror` is a short horror game I developed in Wargaming Academy. It was inspired by [Layers of Fear](https://youtu.be/CyDs5UJfvks). Its main feature is that some pieces of the environment change when you don't look at them. E.g., if a player enters a room, it moves to another place to confuse and scare the player.

Each room is a Unity scene. The game controls the environment by loading the scenes in the additive mode and moving them when particular events are triggered.

The project might be considered either a short 5-minute horror game or a demo of a game that will never be released. All visual assets are taken from Unity Asset Store.

Technologies used: C#, Unity.
